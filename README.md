## Overview 
The repository contains three analysis sections them being:  
1. `baseline-analysis` - this directory contains analysis of SARS-CoV2 negative patients vs SARS-CoV2 positive patients with baseline laboratory values, comorbidities and self-reported medications upon admition;  
2. `baseline-survival-analysis` - this directory contains survival analysis using baseline values mentioned above for SARS-CoV2 __positive__ patients, that were further stratified into survived and deceased;  
3. `longitudinal-sax-analysis` - this is the extension of the survival analysis with the longitudinal measurements that are clustered using SAX method. Again, the two labels in this case are SARS-CoV-2 positive survived vs deceased. 

## Data 
Due to the confidentionality policy the data are available upon request.
